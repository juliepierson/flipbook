about=This plugin creates an HTML animation from an input DEM raster by applying different styles to this DEM. It can be used for example to simulate a change in sea level. Styles are created according to user-defined thresholds in a CSV file. Each line in CSV corresponds to a step in the animation, and each column to a category change. User can specify 2 colors for minimal and maximal values in each category, and a color ramp is created accordingly for the category (see homepage for example). A PNG is exported for each step in animation with the corresponding QML file. An HTML file is created where you can see the animation of these PNG files.
